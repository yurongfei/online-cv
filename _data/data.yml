    summary: |
      With a Bachelor’s Degree in computer science, numerous years of hands-on experience creating and implementing software applications, and the ability to troubleshoot and solve problems in a timely and accurate manner, I confidently express my interest in the position for an experienced software engineer.

      I have been involved in numerous large-scale software releases and understand the importance of time management and open communication. While it may be easy to focus on the technical side of work, I’ve found that being able to express concerns, roadblocks, and alternative solutions to colleagues of varying technical backgrounds has been invaluable in my professional development.

      Over the course of my career as a software engineer I have:

      - Become a certified Software Development Associate and Professional.
      - Led several successful software releases as the Java, team leader.
      - Increased team efficiency by implementing Agile methodologies.

      I truly believe in continued education and research and continue to seek new software and methods to assist with software development. I hope to bring my knowledge, and future knowledge, to your organization.
